# movie-sentiment-analysis
In this program I gather some dicussions about movies from https://www.hometheaterforum.com/community/forums/movies.22/.<br />
Then I used VADER Sentiment Analysis (https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) to analyze movies based on users opinion.<br /></br>

If you would like to run this program, first clone the folder, then make a folder 'data' under it, and run cells in sequence.
